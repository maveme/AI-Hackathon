Following this tutorial you are going to see that is possible to create such bot (at least the front end part of it) following simple instructions and with no coding. A great tool that allows to experiment with agents is <a href=\"https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/\">DIALOGFLOW</a>, a Natural Language Processing platform employed to create a platform- and language-specific application relating to client interactions and dialogues for companies. \n",

    "\"Entities are a mechanism in Dialogflow for identifying and extracting useful data from natural-language inputs.

    "- **user_name**: This is the entity that will extract our user's name. After changing the entity's name, you start entering \"reference values\". We can also define synonyms for these values. In this case, since it is not efficient to create a reference value for every single name existing in the world, we will choose the option \"Allow for automated expansion\", that makes the agent recognize values that were not listed in the entity. \n",

    "\"An intent categorizes an end-user's intention for one conversation turn. For each agent, you define many intents, where your combined intents can handle a complete conversation. When an end-user writes or says something, referred to as an end-user expression, Dialogflow matches the end-user expression to the best intent in your agent. Matching an intent is also known as intent classification.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For our project, we need different intents:\n",
    "- a customized **welcome intent**, that makes the bot answer the call as a pizzeria employee\n",
    "- a **pizza_call intent**, that asks for customer's name and the asks the customer how it can help. \n",
    "- a **pizza intent**, that gets the information relative to the pizza the customer wants to order (pizza_name and pizza_size). It then confirms the order and tells the customer the expected waiting time and ask if that's okay for the customer. \n",
    "- a **no intent**, if the customer does not want to wait that much time. The bot then ends the conversation politely. \n",
    "- a **yes intent**, if the customer wants to wait that much time. At this point, the agent takes the information relative to customer's address. Then it ends the conversation. \n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first intent we want to create is named **Welcome**. In this case we want the intent to be triggered without the need for matched text or spoken input. We can do this by using one of the default **events** on the platform, in this case the \"welcome\" event. \n",
    "We also want the agent to deliver a text rich **response** to the user, \"Hi, thank you for calling pizzeria Italia!\". \n",

When an intent is matched, Dialogflow provides the action to your system, and you can use the action to trigger certain actions defined in your system. For each action we also define a **parameter**. When an intent is matched at runtime, Dialogflow provides the extracted values from the end-user expression as parameters. Each parameter has a type, called the entity type, which dictates exactly how the data is extracted. Unlike raw end-user input, parameters are structured data that can easily be used to perform some logic or generate responses. Our parameter will be required, so that our intent will be incompleted without the corresponding parameter. In the **prompts**, we write the questions the agent will ask user if a request does not contain this parameter. In our case, the questions are going to ask for user name and store the information in the parameter user_name.   We also define the message the agent will deliver to the user. \n",
